# Gato Macro
 A "small" macro for the Roblox game "Anime Vanguard", although I'm looking forward to expanding to other games in the future.

 It should be noted that Gato Macro is built in a way where it relies on contribution from the community, whether it's creating macros using the built-in DevTools or fixing issues regarding the macro itself.
 As always, any contribution helps, if you see any issues, improvements, or even have any ideas, feel free to let me know ( preferably through discord; g.to )
